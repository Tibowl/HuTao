They sang of the stories that blossomed brilliantly like a field of flowers,\nBringing courage, hope, and happiness to the children who had never had the chance to witness a dream,\nWeaving a never-ending song of a thousand nights, lighting up the moments before the long-awaited daybreak.\n\nAfter traversing a thousand dreams, until the nightingale no longer sang, until the fading sun fell beneath the horizon once again,\nThe traveler saw at journey's end that verdant lamp, that faraway homeland of old,\nWhere the dew-covered rose still swayed softly in the moonlit breeze, waiting for her to tell a new story:\n\"Though the memories of past nights have all but faded, we shall continue to sing songs of praise for the sweet dreams that have yet to unfold.\"",

Why else would you be buried here?\"\n\"And so, I must thank you. I now finally understand your true teachings...\"\nBefore a piece of wood becomes an axe's haft, it can neither be picky about methods nor too fastidious about dignity.\nWhether cumbersome formal attire or rags stained with grease and blood, all are costumes required to move upwards.\n\nIn those times â€” nay, perhaps even were a thousand, or ten thousand years to pass since thenâ€”\nThere will always be young people who grow up all too soon, who rise up in society under the banner of the so-called \"survival of the fittest,\"\nWho will feed upon sincerity, gorge upon hope, and devour dreams, metamorphosing into a magnificent monster of the city above ground,\nFor whom the two cities, whether touched or untouched by sunlight, were both bountiful hunting grounds.\n\n\"Oh my. Whose daughter might you be, gentle lady, and what brings you to our Fleuve Cendre?\"\nAs for the noble girl who had stumbled into the Fleuve Cendre, she was, naturally, quarry most worthy of being hung upon the mantlepiece...\nHow the fear dims her beautiful visage, like clouds choking the moon, thought the monster.\nShe recognized the face of a monster, but what slipped out instead was a question as to how her disguise had been discovered.\n\"Well, you're a terrible liar, for one. You've as much as admitted to being an outsider now, haven't you?\"\n\"...And my dear lady, your clothes lack either soot or machine oil, nor have they ever been stained by blood...\"\n\nYes, yes â€” this was a wondrous opportunity, not to be missed, he thought, as he reached out his hand to her.\nThe threads of spider's silk silently hanging down from the clouds above. I shall use this to enter that greatest of houses,\nThis ladder unto the skies, this key unto the gates of pearl.\nI must not let her leave me... I must never leave her...\n\n\"Leticia, your noble soul is one I adore.\"\nA peculiar foreboding struck him as he spoke these words, but nevertheless, he continued to speak...\n\n...\nAll things have their portents, and that was the night before the storm,\nAnd strangely, he was uncharacteristically nattering on about his selfish wishes:\n\"Leticia, have you ever imagined a worldâ€”\"\n\"One with three times the sunshine and boundless fertile lands,\"\n\"One where people are free as birds, free of segregation, free from deception and despoiling,\"\n\"Where we may fly across boundless plains, or rivers and lakes, mountains and valleys,\"\n\"Until we find a tree to call our own, roost there, and build our home,\"\n\"With no one to disturb us, and nothing to trouble us...\"\n\nPerhaps by then, he already believed that the once ephemeral hope had now vanished like smoke,\nOr had already been buried in silence and blood alongside their comrades.\n\n\"Dear Leticia, think of the children, of those newly sprouted trees,\"\n\"Surely they should not be born amidst cannon fire, or grow up amidst the mud and filthy waters.\"\n\"Are we to nurture them with wrathful tears and hateful oaths?\"\n\"Shall we leave them to inherit confused dreams or a mission with its outlook yet unknown?\"\n\nBut no, there is no need to worry, he thought. Everything has already been arranged.\nOur future... My future... It is assured.\nAnd again, he felt a bout of that now-familiar, peculiar foreboding.\n\n...\nBy then, he had not walked amongst nobles for some time already. When asked the reason for his betrayal,\n\"To be rewarded with a position higher still.\" \"To win peace for her and the children.\"\nHe no longer remembered which was the pretext, and which was the truth.\nFor when a liar tells a lie ten thousand times, even they themselves may believe it.\n\nSo when his wife asked him that same question at the last, he still had not figured it out.\nBut he remembered the promise he had made to her.

Sailed he a ship into the belly of a great whale, and fought he a dragon upon the frozen plains for seven days.\nHe and Snegurochka once fell in love, yet lost each other due to the wicked tricks of the changelings â€” a truly tragic tale.\n\nThe last story worth telling goes something like this.\nThe boy born to hunt fish beneath the ice with harpoons fell into a hitherto-undiscovered kingdom.\nThis ancient capital had sunk into the depths of the earth due to some ancient disaster, but despite being buried underground, it was still as bright as the dawn.\nThe solemn and silent king yet sat upon his massive chiseled white throne, the scepter in his hands not yet eaten away by insects,\nAnd the silver-white trees in the courtyard were like the arms of a mother or a lover, holding the virtuous and wise priest in their embrace.\nBeautiful yet treacherous life, twisted and violent monsters, one by one awakened from their thousand-year slumber...\n\nA voice, seemingly from a faraway place...\n\"...Father! Father! Hey! We got a bite!\"\n\n\"...Oh. Sorry.\"\n\n\"So what happened? What happened next?\"\n\n\"Oh, right... Finally, the boy defeated the dragon that slept deep within the kingdom.\"\n\"The dragon's treasure was an infinite hoard of gold. But the boy was kind and brave, and knew that gold was the true cause of calamity and chaos, and so only took a small amount, enough for his own needs, and to cure his sick friends.\"\n\n\"Huh? Is that the end of the story?\"\n\n\"The end.\"\n\n\"Really...? Then tell me another story!\"\n\n\"Another story... Next time, alright?

The Cor Purum seems to wax and wane like a crimson moon, growing steadily brighter and then steadily darker in a never-ending cycle.\n\n\"The myriad mountains of Tianheng are a trove of a thousand treasures, for deep within the rocks bounteous jade gleams gloriously.\" This is to say, mining prospered in Liyue under Rex Lapis' rule.\nOne by one the ore deposits in Mt. Tianheng and the surrounding area would run dry, and the miners would dig further. The result was a network of mine shafts stretching across the region in all directions. At their deepest point, the mines reached all the way to the earth's core.\nSlowly, the once-quiet region was beset by increasingly frequent disturbances. With a deep growl, the earth would tremble, causing landslides on the mountains and cave-ins in the mines.\nIn the night, the aggrieved souls of the innocent who died in the disasters could be heard wailing in the distance.\n\nThen one day, a stranger arrived at Mt. Qingce.\nThe stranger was dressed in a full-length gown and spoke in an esoteric and eloquent manner. He claimed to be a thaumaturge visiting Liyue on a quest to find two craftsmen by the names of Yun and Han.\nYun Huang, the first daughter of the Yun family, was then resident in Qingce Village. She immediately sent a messenger to fetch Han Ce, first son of master craftsman Han Wu.\nThe thaumaturge informed them both that in the past, the Yuns and Hans had jointly crafted a catalyst for the thaumaturges of the world.\nWith unrest now spreading through Liyue, the thaumaturges wished to provide the Yuns and Hans with a piece of crimson Cor Purum, in the hope that it might help the people of Liyue through this troubled time.\n\nOn receiving the message, Yun Huang and Han Ce lit the furnace at once and crafted a blackcliff catalyst with the crimson Pur Lapis at its core.\nThe crimson stone resonated with the ley lines of the earth. A blood-red glow would fade in and out as if to give forewarning of imminent tectonic activity.\nJust as the stars guide those who travel by night, so this catalyst was the light that gave safe passage to the people of Liyue through that tumultuous time of landslides and cave-ins. It was placed at the foot of Mt. Tianheng for all to see.\nWhen peaceful days finally returned, the Blackcliff Agate quietly disappeared without a trace, just as had faded the fury of the earth's core.",

But it is one that the bladesmith must overcome if he is to free himself from the shackles that bind him and reach new heights of competency in his trade.\nHan Wu struggled to see beyond the limits of his casting techniques. Thanks to a contact of his good friend in the house of Yun, he was able to go with a crew to the Chasm to personally procure the materials for his new weapon.\nBut a cave-in trapped the crew in the mine shaft for four days.\n\nImprisoned within the impenetrable rock walls of the cave, the crew found their mining tools to be of no use.\nDeprived of all natural light and thus of all knowledge as to the time of day, one by one the trapped crew succumbed to madness and despair.\nJust when they thought all hope was lost, Han Wu thought he saw a faint flickering emanate from the corner of the cave, where lay the prototype sword he had brought with him into the mine.\nWith that sword he carved their way to freedom, and the survivors emerged from the pits of the earth into glorious bright sunlight. But the moment that the first ray of sunlight made contact with the blade, it shattered into a million pieces.\nAll strength left the master craftsman's legs and he collapsed on the ground. Months later, he remade the sword and declared, \"This sword shall be named the Blackcliff Longsword, for it is made of blackcliff.\"\nAll who beheld the Blackcliff Longsword were bewitched by its beauty, spellbound by its sharpness, and transfixed by its tenacity.\nBut the crew spoke not a word of what they had witnessed during their ordeal in the mine...\n\nDeep in the all-consuming darkness, when the master craftsman struck his blade against the cave wall with all his might, the sword released a deafening roar, like thunder sweeping across the plains.\nPerhaps the crew knew that the sword's cry was to foreshadow an earthquake years into the future...",

It zaps through the air like lightning, unimpeded by the wind.\nMade from blackcliff crystal from head to tip, the body is inlaid with red jade stones for decoration.\nViewed in the moonlight, the swirling of blood-red light can be discerned within.\n\nLiyue master craftsman Han Wu had a son with his first wife. The son's name was \"Han Ce, the Cold and Calculating.\" Cold, because his father wished him to be cool-headed and rational. Calculating, because his father wished him to be precise in his craft, that he might inherit the family business.\nBut Han Ce had other ambitions. During his days as a student, Han Ce idled away his study time on martial arts fiction, while spending his free time practicing the art of the polearm up in the mountains. He was consumed by the desire to become a martial nomad, roaming the world with his pole for protection.\nWhen he scoured the lands in search of Aerosiderite, he sought not the rare ore itself but the thrill of adventure. And when he ascended the highest peaks to commune with the adepti, he desired not the wisdom of the sages but the tale of his travels.\nHan Ce cared not for the flames of the furnace and the working of weaponry. His father scolded him, but it was to no avail. Eventually, Han Ce left home one day without bidding his father farewell.\n\nIn his later years, Han Wu was involved in a mining accident that profoundly changed his temperament. Han Ce caught wind of the ordeal and hurried home to see his father, traveling through the night.\nPreviously hot-tempered and never short of something to say, Han Wu was now calm and quiet. He no longer held any animosity towards his son for his reluctance to take over the forge.\nFinally, father and son grew close for the first time in their lives. Han Ce was ashamed of his past actions, but knew not how to redeem himself.\nSeveral years later, Han Wu breathed his last. Thus ended the life of the master craftsman of a generation. Per his father's will, Han Ce retrieved an archive of weapon designs from the study â€” they were the fabled prototypes.\nThe archive was sealed inside a wooden chest along with a letter addressed to Han Ce.\n\"To my dear son, Han Ce. The world is vast and filled with many marvels. May you always see the wonder in the world, wherever your journey takes you.\"\n\nThe designs were covered in comments penned by his father. Han Ce was overjoyed at the sight and proceeded to peruse them all night long.\nAs Han Ce stepped outside the door of the study at the first light of dawn, he watched in wonder as a meteorite fell from the sky. It crashed down right before him in front of the Han residence, landing perfectly vertical.\nA host of emotions flooded Han Ce's heart. Tears both of joy and sorrow streamed down his face as he cried, \"The heavens have spoken! The heavens have spoken!\"\nHan Ce took the pitch-black aerosiderite and added it to the blackcliff that remained in the forge. Following his late father's designs to the letter, he crafted a pointed pole with a sharp tip that shimmered like ice and a body hard as bedrock.\nHan Ce could have traveled the world with this trusty weapon in hand, but he chose not to. For Han Ce vowed that starting that day, never again would the flames of the furnace die out, and never again would the working of weaponry cease.",

    "lore": "A broadsword wrought from rare blackcliff. Weighty as a boulder, it has enough brute force to carve its way through a mountain.\nThe blade is forged from a combination of blackcliff crystal and a crimson ore. It is pitch black like a pool of ink, with red flames leaping from within.\n\nBlackcliff weaponry has its roots in the ancient \"prototype\" series. Blackcliff blades possess three distinguishing features: hard as bedrock, shimmer like ice, fierce as the blood that gives us life.\nThough the Slasher is a broadsword, it has a uniquely sharp blade, barely thicker than a thread of silk.\nThe join between the red and black crystals is seamless, and each blade segment interlocks perfectly with the next to form a single cohesive body.\nWith the flame motif and red jade stones that adorn the hilt, the sword has a dark and foreboding presence when viewed from afar, like bright-red blood oozing from a bottomless pit of black ink.\n\nMaster craftsman Han Wu once embarked on a quest to find the finest ore with which to cast a blackcliff blade. He searched everywhere, until he became involved in a mining accident.\nWhile trapped in the cave, his eyes perceived nothing but an all-engulfing and profoundly disorienting darkness. His ears rang with the thunderous crashing of rocks, as if the foundations of the world itself were caving in.\nIn the aftermath of this ordeal, the craftsman's furnace lay unused. Where flames once burned bright, frigid dust now gathered as the forgotten fantasies of the forge dwindled and died.\nHan Wu's son, Han Ce, read that the earth's core had been sealed off due to a monster infestation, and rushed to inform his father.\nHan Wu was racked with guilt upon hearing the news. He was certain that it was his trip into the mine that had disturbed the dragon from underground and the meteorite from the heavens. He forced himself up from his sickbed, lit the fires of the furnace once more and forged a mighty broadsword.\nWhen it was ready, Han Ce took the sword into the mine shaft. There, on instructions from his father, he erected a shrine as tall as himself and placed the sword inside to ward off evil and rebuke the dragon.\n\nHan Wu died peacefully in his sleep several years later.\nAt the moment of Han Wu's death, a traveler passing by the mine shaft at Mt. Tianheng saw a crimson light shining out from somewhere within the rocks. As the traveler watched on, a hidden shrine appeared and slowly opened.\nThe broadsword inside the shrine shone faintly, as if weeping with bereavement.\nHan Ce went into the mountains that very night to retrieve the blade.\nThe Tianshu of that age personally engraved an inscription upon the blade:\n\"Carves open mountains and tears through the seas, shreds apart clouds and splits the moon.\"",

A shot from this bow takes to the skies like a meteor, challenging both wind and thunder.\n\nThe house of Yun has long since established itself in Liyue as a family of craftsmen. At the time of this bow's inception, the seventh head of the house, Hui, was well-renowned as a member of the Qixing.\nYun Hui had but one child, a daughter, by the name of Huang. As per familial custom, should she marry, her husband would take over as head of house.\nHaving been raised an unyielding martial artist, Huang refused to take this path, and instead took over as the daughter she was, inciting endless gossip amongst the people.\nBut Yun Huang took control at a hard time.\n\nThe continent was troubled. Even the loftiest of peaks and deepest of caves collapsed to a symphony of low roars.\nThe bounty of the earth beneath them became almost unreachable, threatening to bring an end to the legacy of their craft.\nOne night Yun Huang lay awake unable to sleep, tortured by her worries that her family's name would end with her.\nAmidst the sorrow that enveloped her, she could do naught but call upon the heavens and pray for celestial intervention in her desperate situation.\n\nIt was then that Han Ce, who had long since abandoned his family business and wandered the continent, arrived in the village in his craftsman's attire.\nHe handed Huang a small wooden box, within which were the prototype plans his father had revised in his later years. He also took out a bow and said:\n\"As the issue arose from Blackcliff, so too shall it end by Blackcliff. It is said that the house of Yun appreciates archery. Should it please you, give this bow a try.\"\nHuang fired an arrow into the sky. It roared across the heavens like angry thunder, as the sound of the bowstring being released reverberated throughout the mountains.\nAs she watched the clouds flow beneath the moon, she knew that her prayer had been answered.",

    "lore": "The ancients say that the mountains of Mt. Tianheng are filled with gems, and the depths of The Chasm are rich with jade. The nation of a thousand hills has long been known for its abundance,\nAnd its most critical mining and smelting facilities are located in Blackcliff Forge, carved into Mt. Tianheng itself.\n\nThe Forge was constructed by excavating the mountains, with countless workshops, furnaces, and connecting tunnels blasted black by dust.\nIn the tumultuous years when the fires of war dyed the land red, this place was also where the ancestors of the mountain tribes sought shelter.\nIt is even said that long-forgotten passages are within, tunnels to an ancient underground realm that lies in the deep places beneath the earth...\n\nAccording to the Stone Tablet Compilations, the first to carve the darkened paths through the mountains was the founder of the famous Yun family of Liyue.\nFrom that time hence, their clan, a house of smiths, has taken its place on the stage of history, regarded as honored progenitors by countless generations of artisans thereafter.\n\nAs for the stories of that person, the annals of history leave but a scant few linesâ€”\n\"Such was Yun's ingenious craft that wood and bamboo might be carved into birds who would fly for three days without landing. Such were the works considered the apex of artisanry.\"\n\nThe study of mechanisms and the art of forging were all initially inextricably intertwined with the adepti.\nAs such, the founder was oft regarded as an apprentice of the adepti, and the techniques employed by said founder considered adepti teachings.\nThe tale most widely known today is that this personage once fought alongside Rex Lapis on campaign,\nAnd having accomplished much, was acknowledged by three adepti, one after the other, and was granted instruction in secret mechanical arts.\n\nLegend has it that these divine techniques were such that even clouds could be plucked from the skies with which manses might be molded,\nAnd even the rotting, wasting wood could be fashioned into moving birds and beasts, so alike to life as to confound the observing eye.\nAs such, the phrase \"The Blackcliff, forged from clouds\" has long been widely known in Liyue,\nAnd poets and storytellers have long delighted in the contrast between the two images.\nThough the legend of \"cloud-forging\" is a fanciful latter-day play on the family name \"Yun\" meaning \"cloud,\"\nNone dispute that the rest of the founder's life was dedicated to the Blackcliff Forge and the teaching of craftsmanship.\n\nAt life and legend's end, the founder ascended in heavenly light, becoming the guardian star of artisanry.\nStill, legends are naught but legends. It was no adeptal art that built the Forge, nor was it woven of whisps of wind and cloud.\nInstead, it was chiseled out one flake and one hammerstroke at a time, by the pouring sweat of countless ordinary artisans' brows over long centuries.\nDeus Auri's contract never stipulated that mortal resolve could never surpass adeptal miracles, after all.\n\n\"Such was Yun's ingenious craft that wood and bamboo might be carved into birds who would fly for three days without landing. Such were the works considered the apex of artisanry.\"\n\"Yet Yun's life and career were spent working rock into workshops, and molding clouds into manses. Thus was the Blackcliff forged in Tianheng, that the well-being of all the people might be served.\"\n\"For thus Yun said: What is clever? And what is clumsy? That which benefits the people is clever, and that which does otherwise is clumsy.\"",

All the mortal world was stained.\n\nThose who lost everything in the tumult fled to the mountains, and there they begged for the adepti for shelter.\nDoggedly pursuing those survivors were countless monsters who had long since lost their senses.\nTheir names were unknown, their numbers uncountable, they came on like a flood, destroying all in their path.\nThe other master that they had once revered had fallen, and their fierce roaring was, in truth, a final mourning howl.\n\nBut the mortals then could not have known that the lord who once defended these mountains and waters had now passed,\nAnd that all that stood between them and the onrushing deluge of catastrophe were a few vigilant yaksha who dwelled there.\nAfter several days of fierce battle, white clothes had turned scarlet, and scarlet garments had been stained black. Still, the monsters came on like an endless horde...\n\nAs this tale dates to days ancient beyond memory, the tale thereafter has branched out into many versions. Some say that just as all hung in the balance,\nAn adeptus with azure and white feathers burst from the clouds like a descending gale,\nSolitary, solemn, silent, in proud majesty and dignity did this being defend and administer the forebears,\nTurning a hopeless cause around by vanquishing what had appeared a limitless tide of monstrosities...\n\nOthers say that as things appeared most perilous, two jade-carved cranes hurtled from the skies above,\nAnd in a hail of sigils did they subjugate countless evils as a chill wind disperses an expanse of cloud.\nBut when all turned to look, Lo! There were no cranes, but an adeptus airborne, folding fan in fair hand...\n\nStill others claim that so far above mortal reach was this adeptus's might that the ancestors but heard a crane's cry,\nAnd before them, the endless monsters were as ash in an instant, like dust that dissipates in the sunlight...\n\nNo matter which version of the tale, the people of Liyue thereafter would, when speaking of the adeptus Cloud Retainer,\nWould never fail choose their words with some respect. And as for what really happened back then...\n\n\"Interested in such distant matters? You truly are a person of some leisure.\"\n\"Well, what with a similar mood being upon oneself, one shall speak of it.\"\n\"Now, one believes this tale may be naught but eight or nine hours in the telling, but you should pull a chair up, still...\"\n\"...What?

Now, even these engravings have been eroded by the winds of time, turning into little more than golden grains of sand.\nThe right hand of King Deshret, the head of the Seven Sages, the minister of ministers â€” The Goat King;\nThe great bird winging skyward towards the sun, the King's soul â€” The saint Bennu;\nThe lioness with a human head, the King's will â€” The saint Shesepankh;\nAnd the dragon who obtained the flesh and blood of the King, who never counted itself among the Seven â€” Al-Apep.\nThe four named above have nothing to do with the story that follows.\n\nThe Crocodile King and Ibis King were arguing ceaselessly, as ever, and that day the subject of their debate was the changing of things.\nThe Crocodile King sought a person who possessed mystic arts. That person had been blessed by an Oceanid who was staying there, and any liquid that passed through his hands would transform itself into an exquisite wine, perfectly proportioned.\nThe Ibis King brought forth another rare being, one who had accidentally touched the tomb and remains of an ancient god, and been cursed. Due to the curse, anything touched by both his hands would slowly become pure silver â€” after all, from today, we know that transformation into gold and Mora is the sole province of Deus Auri.\nThe two of them bet on which effect would win out in the end. They also asked Hermanubis â€” who is the last of the Seven Sages to be mentioned â€” to make a conjecture as to the eventual result.\nHermanubis was a sage of the desert, and the leader of the priestly class. For this reason, he was both a warrior and a sage. And as the learning known as alchemy was passed down amongst humans, and he was well-versed in its secrets, asking him to judge was eminently reasonable.\n\n\"Both forms of power clash directly, as sharp spears striking sturdy shields,\" spake Hermanubis, \"And they must each yield unto the other, and take a step back. This is the principle of equilibrium.\"\nIn the end, the final result was that the cup became pure silver, while the silted water within became a fine liquor with suspended grains of silver.\n\nYet the Crocodile King and Ibis King did not understand Hermanubis's admonishment, instead continuing their battle. In the end, they invented a strange summoning magic. And now, the two of them have traversed millennia to continue their battle upon the field of Genius Invokation TCG...\nAll of this is part of this version of the story of \"King of Invokations.\"",

In the end, both the legend and the dragon-slaying polearm were lost.\nFreed at last from the shackles of its past, it displayed the full force of its ferocity once and for all, as if to mark the dragon's return to the ocean where it belonged.",

When Huang frantically declined, Yun said this with a smile:\n\"This pearl is nature's very quintessence. Only one whose heart is clear can use it.\"\n\nThanking Yun, Huang took the Eye and wore it on his person, and slowly made his way towards Liyue. Along the way, neither rain nor wind impeded him.\nAs one who sought after the path of the adepti, Huang wandered the lands without rest. Thus, he would often be at the market to buy water and food.\nThe harbor-side streets were a morass of humanity. Yet Huang walked among them as if idle, and was never taken advantage of.\nSome were curious: how could this bookish exorcist take to the city like a fish to water, and never miss a step?\nWhen asked, he replied: \"This Eye trembles at wickedness, and helps me see which hearts are true.\"\n\nThis Eye could reveal human hearts, though no one knows how it worked, causing many to fall back on folktales to explain it.\nSome say that at midnight, you can dimly hear it call out like a mild breeze, or like spring water flowing between scattered stones.\nBoth are reminiscent of the murmuring of demons that feed on wicked thoughts, a common feature of the parables once told by mothers to their children in days gone by.",

Thus, it soon died out.\n\nClose companions growing up, Arundolyn was from a long line of knights while Rostam was born to a peasant family.\nTheir childhood friendship was forged from a shared dream of heroism. As young men, they became fellow knights; as mature adults, one became Grand Master and the other his assistant.\n\nGrand Master Arundolyn was no Vision bearer. His formidable strength came from a mixture of natural gifts and intense training.\nThe Grand Master's strength was his pride, and the Grand Master was the pride of the Knights â€” nay, the pride of all in Mondstadt.\nAfter Rostam met his fate, Arundolyn never displayed his strength again.

We are the weavers of music, the harmonizers of authority, and the music will advance at our command!\"\n\"Our music is as the waves and the ripples, the rhythm of the truncheon and the caress of a lover, conquering all who hearken!\"\nIn the towering theater academy, the lecturers explained that magnificent music, imparting civilization and art to their ignorant pupils.\nThe notes on the scores and melodies were arranged in flawless order, and were played perfectly with absolute reason and wisdom...\n\n\"But, how can the will of order rely upon adherence to rigid convention? Musicians must be as those who transcend. They must become the voice of the sublime.\"\n\"The sublime must be powerful, like the cry of birds on a mountain summit, the frothing wrath of the stormy sea. Order must have boundless passion.\"\n\"And after, glory shall proceed from passion, passion shall create unity, and unity shall stabilize order â€” this must be the essential role of music and musicians.\"\n\"The passion from vanquishing one's foes, from loving one's comrades â€” these are the sublime emotions that separate humanity into masters and slaves.\"\nLater, just as the opera sang, this unique understanding and interpretation of the music elevated the musician to the loftiest of halls...\nIn that age, under the direction and sole authority of the musician, music became the scepter and shield of authority, conquering countless listeners.\n\nIn the golden era, the listeners were intoxicated with this sublime beauty, and shared joy and sorrow in pursuit of the same passion.\nBut when the people's sight is blocked by a mountainous wave, the wailing of those devoured will be silenced...\nAnd when that towering theater academy was finally destroyed amidst the tsunami, the people were terrified to discoverâ€”\nThe skeletal corpses of those burned away by the musician's passion, exposed at last, sticking up from beneath the foundations.",

Soon, all of this terrible suffering shall be completely obliterated.\nCoppelia: The one who created me and gave me life has already bid an eternal farewell to this mortal coil, and when these rusted gears return to the same ash as his bones, all sin will be forgotten, and for flesh and blood, to be forgotten is to be forgiven.\nCoppelia: Never again need I see the sun, moon, or stars, never again need I hear the birds singing joyously in the forests, never again need I force this lonely heart of mine to continue beating on in a world that is already bereft of he who bestowed it upon me.\nNathaniel: What do you plan to do?\nCoppelia: This heart of mine, which beats as though it were ensconced in a vessel of flesh and blood, has already been stained with the same sin on this journey.

    "lore": "\"The forest used to be a giant maze many, many moons ago...\"\n\nThe last king of the forest had returned to Sarva, leaving one who once waited upon him to inherit the name \"Tiger.\"\nIn the past, wherever there was shade, there was the domain of the forest king. And as he wandered through his own territory,\nThe birds and beasts that depended on the jungle would bow their heads as he passed by to show their respect and reverence.\n\nAll Kings had their own palaces: as each successive king of the forest took the throne, the forest changed according to his image and vision.\nThe palace of the last king of the forest was hidden behind a fence of trees and vines, and beyond a network of water and cliffs,\nIt is the disc of pearls made by moonlight through leaves on still water. The king was at the water's edge, basking in the twice and much moonlight all by himself.\n\nThus did the forest maze come about. Legend has it that the forest king traced the path of a maze in his dazzling dappled stripes.\nEach generation of Kings' palaces piled on top of each other so that the paths would intertwine from tree to tree. Streams would break off or would give birth to new branches,\nThe forest paths growing ever more complex. Only the forest king, we Aranara, and the people from the king tree's sanctuary,\nCould freely go into the forest king's sanctuary and find their own way from tree to tree and stream to stream.\n\n...\nLater, the last king of the forest died protecting the forest. The forest would make no new palace, and the maze would disappear henceforth.\nOr perhaps it was a dark herd of beasts that, like a hurricane, brought down the trees like waves of wheat. Either way, the maze was dead, and so was the forest king.\n\nThe Aranara, who gave me this story, was very timid and did not want us to hear him sing, always seeking a place of solitude.\nOne night, he went through a maze in the forest, and found a bright reflection of the moon in the water. Thus did he hear the story of the last king of the forest. \nThen the current changed and the moon's reflection was scattered. Much has changed, and yet, much will now remain unchanged forevermore.\nBut even if you, like me, have never met a king, you would still get the impression that Tiger was a noble and powerful king of the forest.",

Fortunately, it is just a story â€” not some memory of mine or yours.\nOnce upon a time, the moon turned into the shape of fangs that smirked ferociously. Moonlight no longer waltzed through the leaves to cast itself onto the grass, turning the dew into glimmering pearls.\n\nTrees were thrust down to the ground like wheat overwhelmed by strong winds. Every inch of the land was swamped by grief.\nThe grief was so formidably immense and intense that even the streams were fraught with the pungent odor of salt and iron.\n\nOur creator, Queen Aranyani, trusted us with the forest. We thus embarked upon the battles against the monsters that emerged from the darkness, colossi made of iron and steel, and Marana.\nShe entered the desert with the forest's children. They burnt the roots of disaster and tore the branches of calamity, but only a few of them eventually made it back to the embrace of the shade of trees.\nWe lost Vanarana, and too many Aranara returned to the ground before their time. Even the story that survived was bitter and agonizing.\n\nBut we defeated the calamity in the end. Even in the deepest sea of sand, the lotuses still bloomed.\nShe who created us had once again created new life to mend the land's hollowed heart.\n\n...\nCourage and strength still ring out amidst the most bitter of tales. No story is as powerful as \"memories,\" but they empower nevertheless.\nI will cherish the stories you handed to me, stories of our adventure. Should calamity ever recur and the moon mutate, these stories will protect the forest on your behalf.",

    "lore": "This blade was recorded in the \"Anthology of Inazuman Blades\" written by Inspector Mikoshi Nagamasa of Tatarasuna.\nThere were two swords of the \"Geppaku Futsu\" series made by the Futsu school by order: \"Hasui,\" the Wavespike, and \"Haran,\" the Rippling Upheaval.\nOf these two, the \"Haran\" is the sole blade forged by the great smith Masagomaru that remains extant.\n\nMany say that blades are indwelt with the souls of those who forge them...\nThis is how the Anthology begins.\nIt is said that the Hasui blade was forged by the third-generation master of the school, Master Futsu Minori.\nIts blade was a pale blue, and its hamon was as beauteous as rippling water, and so it was oft found at the waist of the Shogun's valet.\nLater, the blade would be broken during a mortal duel to decide the fate of the oni people, and was sent back for reforging.\nAt this time, Minori, who had by now been long tortured by alcohol, old wounds, and the lingering memories of Tatarigami, was a broken woman, not unlike an untempered steel sword.\nNor could the fourth-generation head Futsu Hiroyoshi match his mother's skill.\nIt was his sworn brother, Futsu Masayoshi, the one they call Masagomaruâ€”\nHe was the one who would forge this weapon, allowing the Futsu school's masterpiece to re-enter this world.\nThe two Geppaku Futsu blades look very similar to one another, but their qualities are in fact vastly different.\n\nMasagomaru would only come to name this one work, and the reason why that happened is quite simple, really...\nHe was an orphan taken in by the third-generation master, illiterate by education and aphasic from birth.\nWhen ordered to revive the beauty of the \"Hasui\" blade, he inscribed its name just as it had been before.\n\nWhen Futsu Minori passed on, Masagomaru would help her pass her forging techniques on to Hiroyoshi.\nIndeed, it is said that she had wished for him to take up the mastery of their school, but he demurred multiple times.\nIndeed, the fame from the forging of the \"Haran\" very nearly affected Hiroyoshi's succession to be the fourth-generation head.\nAs such, safe in the knowledge that his sworn brother was now independent, Masagomaru would choose to depart for other lands.\nLater, he would approach other forging schools, gleaning gems of wisdom from other famed smiths.\nIn his latter years, he would have three pupils that he was most proud of: Kaedehara Kagemitsu, Niwa Nagamitsu, and Akame Mitsunaga.\nThese three would create the \"Isshin Sansaku,\" the three great works of the Isshin Art.\n\n\"Then, I was but a born-mute, an ugly, filthy, abandoned child.\"\n\"Like a moth, I longed for warmth in the bitter, cold nights, and what I found was the forge-fires of the smithy.\"\n\"Standing before me was the third-generation master, she who people called surly and arrogant.\"\n\"But she did not bid me to get gone, and even gave me some rice to fill my stomach.\"\n\"Seeing that I was covered in metallic sand, she named me 'Masagomaru.'\"\n\nUnable to speak but subtle in thought, Masagomaru must have had many stories hidden away in his heart.\nAll those unsaid things would finally sink as sediment, disappearing beneath the waves...\n\n\"The third-generation master would tell me, one who could not speak, a great many things.\"\n\"Like the old wound that afflicted one side of her body, like the wishes of her mother and brother,\"\n\"Like the crimson hakama she could never wear, and the giant wave that would one day devour everything...\"\n\nOne night, the child would enter the smithy, seeing the famed but capricious smith within.\nShe hammered at a chunk of iron, not caring as tears streamed down her face...\n\"You forget what you just saw. We clear about that?\"\nHe nodded, flustered. Then the woman suddenly clapped her hands together and smiled broadly.\n\"Right, silly me! You're a good friend, a real keeper of secrets!\"\n\n\"I suppose it is as they say: one who leans into the drink is themselves not to be leaned on too much.\"\n\"But now that I think about it, I should still have accepted her offer to drink together...\"\n\nThe \"Anthology\" also speaks of the differences in form between the Geppaku Futsu blades.\nThe one forged by Futsu Minori was as gently beauteous as the ocean at night, and thus was named \"Hasui.\"\nThe one made by mute Masayoshi was formidable as the driving hurricane, and was thus called \"Haran.\"",

    "lore": "This item was supposed to be a product sample of a pre-order special for the final volume of King of Invokations #1.\nHowever, due to its unique specifications, the request to produce a sample was misunderstood as one to craft an actual weapon.\nAs such, the editors of Yae Publishing House were frustrated at what transpired upon receiving this bow. Yet Fukumoto, who was present when the bow was delivered, was deeply inspired by this turn of events and wrote the following excerpt, which would later be included in the book as an appendix.\n\n\"The one who wields this bow, shall be the most adept archer under the command of the King of the Great Red Sand.\"\nIt is as everyone said, and a belief that the prussian green-skinned young man held strongly. When the Ibis King displayed his trove of treasures, this bejeweled sandstone-hued longbow caught his eye immediately. It was a time when the young man had yet to be poisoned by destiny, a time when he still believed that all that he desired were accolades to be wonâ€”\nTo him, it was a mere matter of how much effort one had to devote.\nThus, he posed a question to the Ibis King with an easy confidence, \"If I become the most brilliant archer of all, if I possess power and strength surpassing that of the other kings, would this longbow be mine?\"\nSilence fell over the court. In the shadows yet to be illuminated by the lamps, no one dared to answer.\nThere was only one exception: the man atop the throne with eyes as sharp as a falcon's chuckled, and granted the young man's wish.\n\"The day is bound to come,\" the green-skinned youth thought.\n\nBe that as it may, long, arduous years have passed since.\nIt was several hundred years later when the lord of war fulfilled his wish. Possessing the young man who opened the Casket of Tomes, he entered the sealed \"Room of Duels\" again, and only then did he see the longbow held by the phantom.\nIt was as if time stood still, so that the remnant of his soul could pass through the shattered doors and scattered corridors, and return to the chamber of treachery and machinations. Grasping the inescapable golden arrow fired off by the Bow of Secret Rites that was zipping towards him, he saved the body from an unfortunate fate of being impaled through the chest.\nThat had always been part of his plan.\nBut at this moment, the secret ritual dissipated. The arrow was dispelled and the silhouette of the bow-wielder vanished in a flash.\nHe grabbed the longbow before it clattered to the ground.\nHis multiple attempts at seizing this gold-forged bow had ended in failure, which contributed to the rift between him and the Ibis King. Alas, when he finally acquired the treasure that he had long coveted, he found that his heart was as cold as a stagnant swamp, with nary a ripple of joy. The Crocodile King pondered, and concluded that he no longer had such a great yearning to satisfy those unfulfilled desires as he did in his youth.\nMoreover, the revered Lord of the Scarlet Sands had been hidden in many histories, and the Mistress of Flowers had never been seen again. In vying for the mausoleum's throne, strife and chaos broke out amongst the kingdoms. Amidst the turmoil, he took the opportunity to trample the sea of sands in the name of the \"Rite of Duels,\" all to erase the barriers between multitude of worlds and thus incite a frenzied war. To stop him, a lone, elderly figure clutching onto the golden bow, trudged up the steps leading to the ritual...\nThose were but memories of a bygone era.\nHe ran his fingers over the orb on the bow, until it dawned on him that it wasn't dust that was dimming its glow, let alone the fact that this dust was a mere figment of his imagination.\n\n\"Never mind,\" the lord of war thought.\nHe heard the sound of the table being activated again in the \"Room of Duels\", and guessed that the young man whose his remnant soul had once possessed was eagerly waiting for a duel.\nAnd thus he strapped his longbow to his side, painting a picture of victory he had once dreamed of.\nThe prussian green-skinned king slowly paced towards the battlefield decreed by fate.",

Without these, humans will inevitably annihilate themselves.\"\n\"Witness the silent testimony of the deserted ruins lying betwixt mountain and swamp.

After the catastrophe, their forebears were forced to bring their families northward.\n\nThe elders of Qiaoying Village claim that the ancestors of the people of Chenyu Vale came from a chasm to the south.\nThey brought with them a great jade altar, and left behind ancient, enigmatic ruins...\nWhen war among the gods brought tragedy, the ancestors of Chenyu Vale's people were reduced to wandering refugees.\nTheir descendents once believed in a now-forgotten god, and all are now lost to history and consigned to dust.\n\n\"An unsound theory,\" responded the consultant in the dark robes, \"the history of mortals is one filled with rebirth.\"\n\"Glory and ruin both spring from mortals themselves. Without agency, there is no rise or fall to speak of.\"\n\"Ancient ruins lie forsaken, but their former inhabitants, buffeted by fate, live on to this day...\"\n\"The fading of their ancestors has given rise to the prosperity of today... even if they are now assimilated, one with the people of a new god.\"\n\"Even if they are often helpless in matters great and small, they have not been destroyed by circumstance, but rather made their own choices.\"\n\"As for the wisdom and laws of the gods, they are based on the consensus of mortals, and not personal whim.\"\n\nAfter a short while, the trivial debate over tea came to an inconclusive end.

It bears resentment against mortal desire.\"\n\"Swords are merely instruments of misfortune. Without wickedness, they will not birth slaughter. Without hate, they would never know the taste of blood.\"\n\"'Isshin' is the stillness of the mind, free of distractions. This purity of desire empowers the swordsmith to forge tirelessly.\"\n\"But by this token, resentment against living beings is the metal from which a blade that kills shall be forged.\"\n\nIn their frenzied passion to practice \"Isshin,\" the Akame School had always pursued the forging of a killer blade that could reach the extremes of lethality.\nAs such, the body and mind of the members of the Akame School were often withdrawn and short-spanned, their hearts venomously graven.\nThe blades made by the Akame School were keen indeed, but many of them had some evil within that ultimately led to the school itself being regarded by the authorities as \"undesirable.\"\nFor this reason, the Akame School's position as the leader of the Isshin Art, passed down from Mitsunaga, did not last three generations before being rescinded by the authorities.\n\nAfter that, Akame Kanenaga was involved in the Case of the Eccentric and committed treason.\nThis led him to change his name and leave for a snow-covered nation in the far north, to make a humble living in the land ruled by imperious ice.\nThe only wish of the deceased Kaedehara was to see the Isshin Art celebrated by those who understood a sword's beauty.\nBut the swordsmith, the blade, and the Tatarigami were all tools and titles for people to wield...\n\n\"I spent half of my life in pursuit of the vanity that is the Isshin Art, it only turned out that I became another 'Kaedehara'!\"\n\"Ah, what's done is done. My only hope is that the sword born in the ice and frost will not be as weak as its useless title...\"\n\nThe Kaedehara Clan were master swordsmiths whose works best symbolized Masagomaru's style; whilst the Niwa Clan were humble and diligent, skilled in clay tempering.\nIn their frenzied passion to practice \"Isshin,\" the Akame School had always pursued the forging of a killer blade that could reach the extremes of lethality.\nAs he passed away amidst the vast snow, the man only wished to forge a renowned blade with which to restore the name of Kaedehara and win back the recognition of the people...",

I'd be bored to tears.\"\n\"I'd much rather snap off Thunder Sakura branches in a drunken haze and cavort with the impudent youkai.\"\n\"And no, these are not stories of the ancient past, but of a future full of hope.\"\n\"So, You Excellency, might I still have the pleasure of joining you to watch the first pale purple buds that emerge when the snow next melts?\"",

This is destiny's punishment upon me.\"\n\"Become my apprentice. Be my eyes and describe to me the people and things in this gilded desert.\"\n\"I hope to one day weave the poems of heroes into the most beautiful tapestry to exist in the divine courts.\"\n\nCoins are eroded when passed from hand to hand, but noble things become stronger as they change hands.\nHis last owner was a blind poet. Later, the story changed from a tale of a master and a servant to that of a master and apprentice.\n\n\"Before we parted, Mother told me that we would meet again in the eternal oasis...\"\n\"Use this sword as the key to the paradise's gate, and rebuild the kingdom amidst emeralds and pomegranates.\"\n\nHearing the story of the wandering princeling, the aged poet caressed the dull blade of the black sword. At length, he replied:\n\"Thus do our crossed destinies duly end, for I am but a trifle in your epic.\"\n\n\"Master...\"\n\n\"Xiphos, your fate is above those of us humble poets. You should not stoop so low as to write stories for othersâ€”\"\n\"You are the one favored by the Jinni. You, who wield the Key of Khaj-Nisut, are the prince of the once-lost kingdom.\"\n\"Embark on your wanderings amongst the failing kingdoms. You shall create new tales and find the eternal oasis...\"\n\"In the times when I wrote hymns for my overlord and love poems for the prince, I fantasized about writing for the hero of destiny.\"\n\"Allow me, please, to recount your epic â€” the epic of your reunion with your mother and the return of the Lord of Sand's glory to this realm.\"\n\nIn the end, their paths would cross â€” the crown prince who became a slave and then a hero, and the mercenary who fell from the throne.\n\nMany legends mention a certain key. It is said to have commanded the sands to form a flowing river in mid-air and sealed the homeland after the Lord of Sand parted ways with old friends.\nThey even say that it was used to hide the desert tower and paradise of dreams away under the aegis of illusions when the bubble burst and the nations were scattered.\nThis key was passed between the hands of mortal tyrants and kings, till at last it, too, returned to the sand's embrace.\nAs for the aged blind poet, he would follow the trace of stories and blood-tainted footsteps, and finally find his way to the forest...",

Following the footprints left by the Forest King, she stepped into the tiger's garden.\n\"Grrrr! Be it birds or beasts, my stomach bids everyone welcome, while the earth awaits their return.\"\n\"I am the king of the forest. I slaughter, and I foster. Only a puny human like you have I yet to sample.\"\nSo said the tiger. However, the child hadn't yet forgotten your language, and naturally, she couldn't understand the King.\n\n\"Grrr,\" the child imitated.\n\nThe Forest King was amused. Usually, when he spoke, your kind would hide in their wooden houses,\nAnd beasts would lie on the ground, not daring to move even an inch, and birds would fly away towards the sun. Even those Rishboland Tigers, mighty as they may appear, would hide themselves in the bushes.\n\"Grrr! A tiny outsider who does not understand etiquette. Alright, then let me teach you all about the forest, and its language you shall learn.\"\n\"From now on, you are my squire. This forest will forever be open to you and all beings here can do harm to you no more.\"\n\n\"Remember, this whole world is but a dream of the forest. One day you shall awake from your reality and find your place in this boundless hunting ground.\"\n\"Where our prey head without fail, we shall arrive at one day as well. Always keep that in mind.\"\n\n...\nThere will always be a new king to inherit the seat from his predecessor. The circle of life applies to you, to us, and to every being in the forest just the same.\nBefore the squire met her fate together with the King, a lost child stumbled into the palace without scrunching a single fallen leaf.\nShe passed on all her knowledge to the child. Just as this story was passed on to me, that child passed on the teachings to the children who came after.\nLater, some children became the guardians of the forest, passing on the forest's language and the responsibility of protecting the King's land to their future successors.\nAnd others, when they gazed upon the great agony others suffered, decided to bid farewell to the hunting ground and become hunters who would terrify even the most vicious beasts.",

Death whispered through the wooded maze, groping for a path to follow.\nFollowing the exile's footsteps, the curse spread across the desert sands to swallow the \"living\" lands.\nThrough jade hallways and pathways narrow, she discovered the intruder's intent from the strangeness of their scent...\nAdrift between memory and ambition, however, the exile was lost amidst the discord of running water and birdsong...\n\n\"You have been struck with one of my arrows, insolent invader! The next shall find its path into your heart.\"\n\"No longer shall you loiter in the forest. No longer shall you disturb the dreams of the children. The crown you seek, you shall not find here!\"\n\nThus did the hale huntress warn her prey, that none yet had ever evaded her arrows or her perspicacity.\nYet, for reasons unknown, she lowered her bow by a few inches and deliberately missed the addled man.\nThe greenery looked on, bewildered, and the dream-hidden children exhaled as blood went unspilled.\nThe slumbering forest king, blessed with insight that can pierce through all dreams, understood her intent and gave a thunderous murmur that caused even the greatest of trees to tremble:\n\n\"That mortal is not alike to you. He comes from a sordid land, and his hands are stained with blood, while his heart festers with delusions and madness.\"\n\"But the forest only keeps dreams wrought from naivete, and blood is only meant to be shed for the hunt or in sacrifice â€” in this there can be no deception.\"\n\"If you believe that he yet has the potential to reclaim his honor in the maze, then guide him to break off the pale branch...\"\n\"Only then can the bright moon and the newborn stars grant him pure wisdom and help him shed his bitter memories and desires.\"\n\nSo, she again took hold of her pure-white bow and drove the exile, sending him fleeing into the depths of the maze...\nThe truth of what happened afterward was witnessed by the moon and the stars, and only dwells still in the dreams of children.\nSome rumors say that the exiled noble finally used the pale branch to forge a blade that belonged to him and him alone,\nWhile some children claim in their sleep that he forgot the name of his home, and of his dream to be king.\nRegardless, Prince Faramarz's name vanished within the rainforest henceforth, returning to the desert on the back of sand carried by the wind.",

The one addicted to hunting shall finally be executed by the falcon he spoils.\"\n\"My mother, a Jinni, taught me the seven-fold sword dance. If I win the throne for you, I shall no longer have to flatter others, and that will satisfy me.\"\n\nThe conspiracy to bring down the kingdom was thus drawn up on the bed-mattress, and the gentle words of the lovers were also sharp blades.\nThe tyrant thus returned to the land of searing sands in an ugly fashion, and the great cause of conquering kingdoms and harems finally vanished into thin air.\nThe rise and fall of the city-state were but a drunken dream, during which the kind and the evil alike were crushed by an immense millstone like wheat husks.\nThe concubine adept at her sword-dancing failed to become the queen in the end, and the wise old retainer who survived to tell the story too lost his eyes.\nThe displaced, thrown into the sea of sand by the whirlpool that consumed everything, became wanderers or mercenaries before being engulfed by the forest...",

Or perhaps it is because they are drawn to the romance of sailing away on an adventure.\nLike the ocean, this chart answers to no master. Like the seafarers, it harbors the romantic dream of exploring every corner of the world.",

Every young man's rage at injustice must turn to calm. Every passion must be ground into dust by the march of time, before being turned to wild paranoia upon that inverted, ancient tree. Even the branch of the tree of time upon which the great and glorious Reman Republic nested would be cut off in the end, such that the nation founded by the other twin child of the wolves might rule.\nEverything in this world must pass through the doorway of their destruction unto the future kingdom of the Prinzessin. In the silence of her pitch-dark Nachtgarten would they find a place to slumber.\nEven so, when Droctfult fell at the hands of the Beast of the World, having fought for the dreams of a young man and the rain that had yet to fall, and was torn to shred by its claws, the Prinzessin still began to tear up.\n\n\"Hearken well, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins. The Sovereign of the Immernachtreich weepeth not.\"\nShe went on, \"Who among those born into this world are not burdened with sin? When the clock sounds for the time of judgment once more, the skirt of night shall descend once more. Then, the writhing struggles of man and beast trapped within will be naught but a midnight waltz.\"\n\n\"It is as you say, mein FrÃ¤ulein.\"\n\"Hmph. As well you should know.\"\n\"Well then, mein FrÃ¤ulein, I wonder if you still recall this tale...\"\n\nTwo of the three bright moons that caused the perfumed sea of the primordial universe to shine and stirred up the beasts of the Arianrhod Realm were shredded by a sword that tore the horizon asunder, left in smithereens too small even for the mystical sight of the Prinzessin.\nOr perhaps this was what happened: the bright moons that once illuminated a universe, brought dreams and song to the sweet sleepers of three worlds, and awakened a deep longing in the beast-herds that wandered betwixt dawn and dusk â€” they were at last rendered dust. But even so, they too wished to remain within the eternal, shining gaze of the Prinzessin, bringing their subtle light unto more lands still.\n\nIndeed. A Prinzessin does not shed tears.\nThat was merely a natural secretion from her royal eyes, affronted as they were by the untimely intrusion of those impudent grains of sand.\n\nâ€”Volume Endâ€”",

When night came, they would leave the pearl-colored palace to roam the desert, and Nilotpala Lotuses would bloom at their feet.\n\n...\nUltimately, two moon-wheels shattered into dust and disappeared. The last of the sisters was so overcome with sorrow that she would never leave her palace again.\nAfter a long time, the moon debris finally fell to the earth. At that time, the god of vegetation had already brought the forest to the desert lands.\nWhere the dust of the moon fell, the Nilotpala Lotuses bloom. And those children who breathe in the dust will have a pearl-like moon in their hearts.\nThis is why there are always children who are confused by the moon, and the reason why the Nilotpala Lotus blossoms every night, and why the moon always favors these children.\nBecause the three sisters, who mirror each other, long to be reunited.\n\nThe Nilotpala Lotus withered after telling this story. She had waited long â€” long enough for the desert to become a jungle, and for the great race to be dethroned,\nLong enough for us to appear on the earth, and for the Aranara who told me this story to appear before her and speak to her.\nThat Aranara lost many, many more memories time and time again, until Vanarana was destroyed and we entered a dream.\nBut that is just as well, for the story of the moon will grow into a pearly moon in our hearts as well as yours.\n\nChildren fascinated by the moon will weep when they gaze upon it, for the moon has turned into fine sand and entered their eyes.\nIn countless tales, not a single tear will be in vain.",

The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.\nThe disc represents the cosmos and thus takes a circular form. At the center is a piece of Cor Purum, representing a heavenly body suspended in the firmament.\n\nAfter the great chaos subsided, sinister forces still remained in the world. Thus, people abandoned traditional martial arts and tools and espoused the supernatural arts.\nBut the techniques used in catalyst production were antiquated, having remained unchanged in over a century. Thus, the catalysts of that age were fragile and broke on first use.\nThe thaumaturges flocked to Liyue and pleaded with Yun Hui, head of the house of Yun, to design a new type of catalyst for them.\nYun Hui proceeded to add a catalyst to the then-new series of improved weapon designs known as \"the prototypes.\"\n\nThe disc is made of wood and rare ore. The Cor Purum in the center was a gift from the thaumaturges.\nCor Purum is produced by firing Cor Lapis in an urn for seven days squared (that is, forty-nine days) and then steeping it in fresh water drawn from a mountain spring for a further seven days squared.\nThe dual purification of fire and water renders Cor Purum unbreakable, and the thaumaturges also believe it allows the stone to act as a vessel for primordial cosmic energy. A catalyst with Cor Purum at its core can channel cosmic energy with the turning of the disc. Twelve full turns works the energy into its purest form.\n\nYun Hui observed that the Cor Purum had a warm, golden glow like that of amber. After discussion with the thaumaturges, he proposed to name the catalyst \"Prototype Amber.\"\nThereafter, all catalysts made in Liyue were modeled on Yun Hui's prototype.",

The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.\nWeighing in at close to forty pounds, this weapon's hilt is made from a rare ore, while the blade is forged from the finest steel. All you will see when it is swung are blinding flashes of light, powerful enough to devour the clouds and blot out the moon.\n\nAfter the great disaster, the Yun family forge joined forces with master craftsman Han Wu to find a way to push past the constraints of contemporary blade design and revolutionize their craft.\nThus was born a new series of weapon models, simply named \"the prototypes.\" The first greatsword built using the new design was unusually understated in its final appearance.\nThe underwhelming sight of dull, blotchy gold masked the weapon's true strength. While not much to look at, any who cared to try it would discover that it was weighty but not unwieldy.\n\nHan Wu, the master craftsman who forged the weapon, traveled north through the night to hand the sword over to a martial artist who followed the chivalric code.\nThe martial artist inspected the blade closely before trialing it. The blade howled like the wind and in an instant decimated the entire bamboo forest. It was a rare sight to behold.\n\nThe martial artist said to Han Wu, \"This blade is endowed with the elegance of antiquity. It is of equal value both as a weapon and an ornament.\"\n\"Such a fine creation possessed of both scale and subtlety is worthy of a prestigious name. May it be known as Archaic.\"\nDue to its unparalleled strength, this sword subsequently became the model for thousands of greatswords in Liyue.",

    "lore": "An ancient prototype pole weapon from Liyue's arsenal. The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.\nThe pole is made of black steel inlaid with gold. A lightning motif runs along the body, featuring streaks of lightning interspersed with stars. The addition of gold leaf gives it an exquisite finish.\n\nBy the time the monster threat was quelled, the remaining troops were few and far between, and each joined the civilian community where they were based. Though peace now prevailed, it sparked a martial arts renaissance that spread throughout the land.\nDemand for all kinds of weaponry spiked, especially for superior quality items, and manufacturers could not keep pace. To find a solution, Yun Hui of the house of Yun met with master craftsman Han Wu and the two conducted intensive research behind closed doors.\nBy the time they emerged, both men's beards had grown by twelve inches. Their new weapon designs, \"the prototypes,\" were finally ready to revolutionize weaponry manufacturing in Liyue. It was time to do away with the shackles of the past that plagued their craft.\n\nThe first pole built to the new specifications had a black-and-gold appearance. The spike at the tip was two inches longer than the previous standard. It was truly a deadly weapon, but one with a composed and commanding presence.\nIt was left to bask overnight in the moonlight. At the first light of dawn, the tip shone with the cold, piercing light of a star against the dim sky.\n\nAt this ethereal sight, Yun Hui's mind was flooded with memories of his father's glory, for his father's name made reference to the stars. Greatly moved, he decided to dedicate the weapon to his father's memory.\nFor this reason the weapon became known as \"Starglitter\" among later practitioners of the halberd arts in Liyue.",

Yougou,\nFeared the ominous power of the Pestle, and would not come forth to face the Lion King!\n\n...Of course, the children never believed such tales.\nStill, the Otogi King truly was very strong. Even seven men together could not push him out of a dohyou.\nAnd when he saw children hankering after fruit they could not reach, he would kick the tree and send the melons plummeting down.\nThat said, he did once kick the whole tree down, and was chased into the mountains by an old man.\nHe also once brought the children to crash an official autumn leaf-watching concert,\nCrying in a loud voice \"The Otogi Kongou Lion King is here. Demons beware!\"\nHe then wrestled with the petite oni who just happened to be in the mood for a tussle... The results were too tragic to watch.\n\nBut if this was all the King had, to the point where he was never given the right to wear the Shogun's colors,\nHow could he, the children said, possibly bring those youkai of song to heel?\n\n\"Hah! I was just suffering from the chills after a long night of drinking, that's all!\"\nEven as the Otogi King made his excuses, he did not forget to laugh heartily.\nWas he just shameless, or did he really believe that he could win? No one could say...\n\n\"This time, I'll definitely cut off the horns of those monsters,\"\n\"And bring them back for ya. That'll show you the might of the Otogi Kongou Lion King!\"\n\"Those creatures from beyond the ocean? Pfft! Easy pickings, I tell ya!\"\n\n\"So yeah, shoo, shoo, follow the fox envoy to go hide in a corner and stuff.\"\n\"I'll swing by later. We'll have ourselves a few wrestling bouts then, eh?\"\n\nEven as he said that, the children remembered how the dainty oni had huffed softly,\nHurling the roaring, onrushing Otogi King into the sky...\n\nLater, the oni who had wrestled with the Otogi King would flee after having her arm and horn cut off,\nWhile the Great Tengu would no longer appear before humans, living in hermitage in the mountains and woods.\nAnd so, the empty boasts behind this greatsword came true in the end,\nThough the wandering, eccentric Otogi Kongou Lion King himself never returned again.\nEven later on, the Lavender Melon tree that he kicked down would, with careful tending, once again bear fruit.",

What mattered was to roar, loud and clear, in the heat of bloody battle. That was duty fulfilled.\n\nSuch hot blood running through the veins should not have been conducive to a long history for the Imunlaukr Clan.\nFor their fight was one without end, and without hope of victory.\nAnd yet, as the snow slowly melted and Mondstadt began to take shape, gradually they realized: They had found something to fight for at last.",

Its blood had long been washed clean.\n\n\"When the sea and winds are right, I will go forth to sea and avenge her, O maiden charmed by the tidal song.\"\n\"So what if I sleep with the fishes?

Too much grief has flowed through the waters already.\"\n\"I ask but one thing of you, noble warrior â€” take this conflict away from this land.\"\n\"Taint these pure waters with 'death' no longer. Let us preserve our final home.\"\n\nConquering youths often believe their bodies and hearts as tough as the marble that adorns city walls.\nBut just as all kingdoms must fall into silence, the agitated strings added dissonant notes to the hero's poetic saga...\n\nMillennia of shifting legends and theatrical edits have given this tale all manner of extended developments.\nIn some versions, the hero, who once subdued cities and nations unnumbered, heeds the words of the fairy maiden.\nHe accepts the proffered bow from her hands and sounds the withdrawal, only to be slain en route by conniving traitors, his body consigned to the ocean depths.\nIn other tales, the illustrious Aurelius falls into agonizing, maddening love, he leads his army into the pine forest,\nSeeking her out, yearning to see her once more and make her his lover, that she might stay by his side.\nThe young maiden flees to the riverbank, weeping as she appeals to her pure-water mother to save her from the obsessions of the hero.\nThe ruler of the Many Waters took pity on her fate, turning her into a pine tree.\nThen, the bowstring that once shot love into Aurelius snapped like the heart the arrow had struck, and it fell by the maiden's side in silence, sinking into the countless blooming Pluie Lotuses.\nThe pained young hero stared at the flowers in the water and would not leave, eventually falling into a deep pool...\n\nNatural philosophers who came after would claim that according to their research, a barbarian tribe named Dryas had once settled here,\nWhich led to the pine forest being named as such. Such unromantic explanations have never had much to do with theater.\nWhether he met his end sinking into the deep sea, to have his will and desire sanded down by the passage of time,\nOr if he resurfaced after many years, only to be slain by the new White Armada or the Marechaussee Hunters,\nThe tale of the youthful hero ended, and Dryastis too was rendered naught but a legend born from chaotic times.\n\nAnd as to how this bow, that had so disturbed Aurelius's destiny, came to pass into the hands of someone who dwelled deep beneath the waters after changing hands many times,\nThen be adorned and modified into a theatrical prop for children's performances in that person's homeland... That is a different tale altogether.",

I don't know which hues to use to capture the landscape of thawing ice and snow that my father so longs for.\"\n\"I wish I could see you again...\"\n\nThis was the answer he foundâ€”\n\nThe hero ended his fruitless journey at last.\nTainted black blood dripped from the blade of his greatsword,\nAs he trudged through now-foreign snowy paths.\nBut when he returned to the great hall of that mountain country,\nNaught but ringing deathly echoes welcomed him.\n\n\"So even here, there is nothing left for me to protect...\"\n\"You who dwell in the heavens, you must wish for naught but to watch our ashen suffering here below.\"\n\"In that case, then let me help you pass the time with a song of iron and blood.\"\nThe outlander left the Starsilver originally meant to shatter snow and wind alike between the frescoes.\nThen, he descended the mountain to search for a land full of war and strife â€” a place he might paint red with blood.",

Now released from its container, it shines evermore.\nIn the hands of a truly knowledgeable sage, perhaps its extraordinary power would finally be unleashed after lying dormant for millennia.\n\nA story that has long been popular with the jewelers of Liyue holds that the master craftsman Kunwu once took the light of the heavenly bodies and sealed it in a wooden box.\nKunwu then buried that box deep inside a dark, rocky chamber, where it remained in pitch blackness for forty-nine days and twenty hours, till finally the pearl within had absorbed the shine of the sun and moon.\n\nA most bizarre tale indeed. And yet, to this day, many in Liyue hold steadfastly to their belief in the esoteric talents of the master craftsman Kunwu.\nSomeone once plucked up the courage to ask the aging craftsman what his secret was. The eccentric old man laughed off the nonsensical notion of his mystical capabilities:\n\"Pfft! 'Twas purely the product of prolonged polishing!\"\n\nBut his apprentice revealed a different story when asked about it in private: Just as Kunwu finished polishing the Solar Pearl, the splendor of the heavens shone down and a crimson moon filled the sky.\nBut did this phenomenon mean that Kunwu had indeed received divine assistance in his craft? Or was it a measure of his own accomplishment that his lofty ambitions had sufficed to send waves through the firmament and even elicit a response from the heavenly bodies?",

One met with the proud Harmost during the war and ultimately rose to inherit his authority.\nThe other hid amidst the bones and was taken in by the chieftain of Aremorica, to guard those pure waters not yet seized by the God King.\nTwo people who had been lulled to sleep by the same lullabies and sea breezes, found themselves now drifting apart, one on each side of the conflict.\n\nAnd so, guided by the tides and the whispers of the spirit, the sword-singer of destruction set out on her quest.\nShe faced unimaginable trials and endured sufferings never before known.

    "lore": "First, the sun and the moons were created, and thus day and night came to be. She once described the night sky adorned with three bright moons to me in a language I have now forgotten â€” yes, the number of moons should be three.\nMay the shadows of the world cast their pearly shimmer upon the earth when they awake, such that people can follow the silver-plated outline of the dunes at night to find their final fate.\n\nNext, weight was created. Thus sand sank, forming the earth. And that which was without weight became the sky. I stipulated that one should rely on the earth, but dream of the sky.\nThe weight should not be excessive, or the land will bind people's feet, impede those longing to travel far, and hinder expansion through exploration, while causing people to be unable to fly high, unable to explore the future.\n\nThen the seven sage monks were established again, and they ruled the trajectories drawn by the earth, water, and stars. Even if the celestial sphere was just an illusion, myths are often born when people look up at the stars and moons.\n\nIn the original world, the barriers were torn down, and the dark poison had penetrated the earth. To heal that fragile, sad, and imperfect world, the spikes descended and pierced through the earth's crust.\nHowever, the rules I have set are more elegant and precise, so there is no need and there should be no followers of hers who shall die meaninglessly on their account, and no poetry should be lost for their sake.\n\nNext, the beastly trail from the poison should be cut off, for taking poison is a sin running deeper than the sky. But how sweet the whispers can be, and how clear the wisdom of which they speak...\nThe wind arises in the new world. The pearly moonlight, the amber afterglow, the waves of grass, and the roots of the waters have gradually ceased to be silent, all singing the poems that she left behind.\n\n...\n\nThe cycle of seven must be removed, because the secret narrative will be blocked.\nFear and grief must be torn down, and so the barrier between life and death must be removed.\nRemove the sun, the moons, and weight, for there should be no barriers between time and space.\nRemove the original principles of rules, verdicts, and grace, so that she will no longer be afraid of the punishment that is laid on her kin.\nRemove birds, beasts, fish, dragons, humans, and seven monk-kings, so that none shall steal wisdom.\n\n...\n\n\"The Sand King sleeps alone in secret dreams, drawing up new theorems.\"\n\"None shall have to drink salt water in the King's realm, for everything in the new world shall be good.\"\n\n...\n\nThis is how perfection can be achieved. I can see the three of us debating in our paradise once more. We are so close.\nYes, this is splendid. I understand now. This is what I have always wanted. That which I have always longed to find once more has never been a paradise for the many.\nAll the parodies of the teachings and the seven wise monks, or that so-called pure world free of all sorrows, none of those things matter anymore...\n\nBut I do not wish that the poison ingested by mistake should remain in this world. Perhaps she might, in light of our old friendship...\nâ€” Even if she will not do it for my sake, that is also fine. I only ask that she do me one last favor for the sake of our mutual friend...",

Though every tribe has chased you from their sight, though we are always at odds,\"\n\"But in my eyes, you, club-carrying Tenoch, are a hero among heroes, a brother amongst brothers!\"\n\nThe third to be found by the hero Tenoch was the cunning Sanhaj Kompore and his enigmatic companion Mahamba.\nSanhaj had been persuaded by the \"talking stick\" before, and the hero agreed to give him the spoils before he agreed to join the fellowship of warriors.\nKompore had foreseen his and Tenoch's heroic end, and how the place that would become known as the \"Mare Jivari\" in later days would be born.\n\"But nay, it matters little, it matters not! Perhaps there may come a day when the scoundrel made famous for being clever as a viper shall become a hero.\"\n\nThe fourth willingly volunteered to join the hero Tenoch. This was young Burkina and his reckless companion, Kongamato.\nBurkina had never experienced the hardships of battle with Tenoch, but the imposing obsidian club guided him towards the perilous journey.\nWar had left countless scars upon Tenoch's body, and for Burkina, these were the proof of the path that he too must tread...\nRevolution should be the fate of the young, to bleed for burning justice, rather than rotting on a comfortable bed of grass.\n\nThe fifth to be persuaded by the hero Tenoch was Sundjatta, chief of the mines, and his steady companion Muhuru.\n\"For the stability of all the tribes, and to avoid further conflict, I once petitioned the Pyro Archon to vote for your expulsion.\"\n\"But even today, you have yet to give up on bloody battle... It just as well, then, that this may be the final battle of our generation.\"\n\"If you are so determined to go, then I have no reason not to accompany you, but do not involve my tribe.\"\n\nThe sixth to go with the hero Tenoch was his greatest foe in his youth, the giant Tupac. No mount could possibly support his massive body.\nWhen Tenoch carried his huge club to Tupac's dwelling to speak with him, he found him carefully counting the multitude of scars left on his body by challengers.\n\"Over 300 scars, twenty broken bones, and over 100 shards of obsidian buried deep within my flesh, like tiny jewels.\"\n\"Two hundred minor wounds, two broken ribs, and one eye that will never again perceive distance. The trophies you left me are equally generous.\"\n\nThe two former enemies burst into riotous laughter, and they joined hands.\nAnd thus, Tenoch found allies from each of the six major tribes.\nGlittering like the flames of roaring wildfire, they crashed into the mountains of darkness...",

Whaddaya think?\"\nThe excited youth sitting at a snack stall next to the Fleuve Cendre spoke without hesitation.\n\"Parsifal? What about me, then? Am I to be the lady of the sapphire, the beauty you stole?\"\nReplied the youngster's partner. Laughter lit up the undercity that had never seen sunlight.\n\nAnd thus, the two young thieving sisters who made their living cheating and stealing at the glorious opera house,\nWere dazzled by the comic stories of knights-errant onstage, and forgot their original purpose for entering the theater,\nAnd the idea of relying on their skills and technique to step onto the stage, under the shining lights, began to bud,\nOf using their brilliant performances to illuminate equally the dreams of those forced to stand, as well as those seated in luxurious VIP boxes.\nOne of them would play \"Parsifal,\" the other, her assistant Josephine.\nTheir first performances were in Eduardo's taverns, beside the sewers, and in front of food stalls,\nFrom being before the eyes of children, brightly shining out from beneath faces stained with ash and oil and amidst the applause of the denizens,\nTo the bright spotlights of the splendorous theater, brilliant, burning like the sun.\n\"Feathers into Butterflies,\" \"Paradise,\" \"Fire in the Mirror,\" \"The Golden Fish\"...\nJust as the light of these performances illuminated both the luxurious VIP booths and the standing audience,\nThe name \"Parsifal\" became the talk of the town in the cities, both above and below.\n\nThose clothed in purple say that all have their place, and those before the stage are no different:\nWhether in the exquisite booths overlooking the stage, or along the crowded floor with standing room only.\nYet, though the light of the performance shines equally upon all who see it, outside the theater,\nBriefly forgotten anger and indignation will permeate, like tree roots penetrating a stone wall.\n\nDuring the Fleuve Cendre operation, that wall finally collapsed.\nThe girl who always played Josephine rushed back to the Fleuve Cendre.\nApart from the ever-present smell of iron and rot,\nThere was only the smell of anger, grief, and blood that had not yet dried.\n\nAll the people knew Parsifal, but an assistant is merely an assistant.\nIf that really was all things were, it would be simple, and easy.\nBut just as the assistant on stage is lopped in two by the sword, yet never harmed,\nAnd the missing pocket watch always returns to the audience unseen,\nThe girl finally lost her \"place\" in life.\nAnd thusly she designed a \"grand magic trick\" that belonged to them.\n\n\"It is I, the masterful magician â€” Parsifal 'the Great'!\"\n\"You will bear witness to a fantastic world, never before imagined!\"\n\"Here there shall be no aristocrats, no kings â€” no swords shall be pointed at you!\"\n\"None shall be born into wealth, none into poverty inescapable!\"",

But in the good news, he won that unmatched bow.\n\n\"Behold, Konbumaru, this is Tengu archery. Watch and learn!\"\nHe was given this rather ridiculous nickname, but ultimately, he witnessed the Tengu's form.\nSoaring through the clouds unfettered, unleashing thunderbolts with every bowstring's pulse...\nIt was a true, unreserved dance of death. Fierce and unpredictable, elegant and beautiful.\n\nMany years later, he was no longer a servant boy, and he had grasped both some archery and swordsmanship.\nHe was referred to the Shogunate through a recommendation letter from his impatient master.\nIn the years under the Shogun, his martial skills improved greatly, and he made many friends and enemies.\nStill, his hobby of unrestrained wanderlust had not changed. On the contrary, with the Tengu's great bow, he became yet more fearless.\n\n\"Let's make a wager this time, shall we? Hmm. Right, then. This bow shall be my wager.\"\n\"I bet on the mightiest bow in the world that I will return here alive.\"\n\"I'll leave it here with you for now. If I, Takamine, lose our bet, you can keep the bow.\"\n\"After all, you've inherited the essence of my archery techniques. You'll be able to make good use of it.\"\n\"But if I win...\"\n\nWhen disaster swept in from across the distant sea, the samurai and the obstinate shrine maiden had a mutual wager.\nThey bet on his safe return from the abyss against the inscribed bow bestowed by the Shogun.\n\nWhen the dark venom sank deep into the earth and peace returned, the swordsman did not come back.\nThe Shogun's bestowed bow was given to the shrine maiden as her prize for winning their great wager.\nLater, in the forest where the Kitsune Saiguu would no longer appear, in the promised meeting place,\nThe lone returnee who came stumbling back from the abyss finally met the shrine maiden again, though by now she could no longer be called young.\nDull eyes stained with dried blood and tears regained their radiance, but were pierced through by a barbed arrow glowing with power.",

The once renowned Minister of the Navy had resigned with honors.\nPickman busied himself for many years attempting to persuade the Court of Fontaine to salvage and rebuild the \"Sponsian.\"\nBut his efforts were in vain, and the families of the fallen believed his efforts to rebuild the Fontainian Navy were little more than an attempt to fish for more glory...\nIn the end, the only thing remaining besides falsehoods and legends was this blue and white epee that once belonged to the Admiral.\n\n\"The 'Sponsian'? Awful name. What were you thinking, Pickman?\"\n\"The name of a usurper? Why, he and his dynasty may never have even existedâ€”\"\n\"Anyway... I was just thinking aloud, y'know, and it just slipped out. Apologies, Captain.\"\n\n\"Relax, Pickman. You know what? Let's just call it that.\"\n\"That sense of unreal reality, I don't hate it.\"\n\nMany legends regarding the \"Sponsian\" and \"White Armada\" remained popular for some time after the destruction of the splendorous opera house,\nAnd they were staged at the newly-rebuilt opera house on Erinnyes to great success, until an accident put paid to such performances.\nOf them, the most memorable performance is the final battle of the armada: A heroic battle with a formidable barrage performed by ten battleship cannons onstage,\nWith the details having been reconstructed from the records of Basil Elton's First Mate.\nPerhaps Pickman did not think that absurd action worth writing down, just as he never once discussed it,\nOr perhaps the writers removed that detail from the script, feeling that it detracted from the intended epic tragedy,\nBut Basil Elton boarded the flagship once more after several years away, and muttered to Pickman and the other sailors:\n\"Looks like this time we can finally open fire on our enemies.\"\n\nIt was only after that she smiled and called out, as performed in the opera house:\n\"Well now, boys and girls! Can't do without me, I see! But if you wanna get nostalgic over tea, it'll have to wait!\"\n\"First, let's send that oversized punk who doesn't know what's what back down to the bottom of the waterfall!\"",

    "lore": "\"Umbrellas from Inazuma are more like unique pieces of artistry than something to shield oneself from the rain. Whether it be the design of the bamboo handle, the patterns on its surface, or the colors of the oil paper beneath beads of water, the umbrella looks in every way exquisite and delicate. Each time I pass through an alley and see such an umbrella outside a store, I often find my thoughts drifting back to a certain event. Rumor has it that there once was an umbrella that sent the whole town aflutter with activity. Here's how the story goes:\"\n\"Hundreds of years ago, during the season of a grand festival, the flowers were in bloom, the foxes were at play, and even the typically stoic Tengu mingled amongst the people. Yet, the most eye-catching oddity was a girl bearing an intricate umbrella while sipping the fine wine of the Oni Clan. As she grew inspired, the young maiden danced like billowing flowers amidst the snow as the moonlight poured down on her. All who beheld her found themselves cheering her on, be they human or youkai. But with the passage of time, the girl went to war with the army and met a most untimely fate. With her passing, her cherished umbrella was offered to a shrine by her loyal subordinates.\"\n\"A daughter to a prominent martial family encountered the umbrella when offering her prayers at a shrine. Hence, she decided to purchase it at full price. The next day, with the skies wet with rain, the girl wanted to seize the opportunity and venture out with her umbrella. However, before she could even get changed, a message was delivered from afar, informing her of her husband's death in battle. Consumed by grief, the girl fell ill and left this mortal plane to seek her lover within the stretch of days. After her funeral, her parents regarded the umbrella she bought as something of a cursed object and returned it to the shrine to be sealed away.\"\n\"Yet, after a few months, new rumors spread. People would claim that, on rainy nights, a previously unknown youkai would stalk the streets. The way the youkai was illustrated made it sound akin to an umbrella, except taller than a man, bearing a single eye, a single leg, and also a long tongue. Should someone walk alone at night, the youkai may just suddenly appear, using its long tongue to lick those that dare pass by. From the perspective of those who live in Fontaine, the youkai presented little threat with its main acts seeming like pranks. That said, few people actually knew what the youkai's true intentions were. This engendered a sense of worry amongst the people who walked the streets. Young maidens dared not to leave home. The elderly sighed, saying if the wise and powerful were not absent, dealing with this youkai would be a trifling thing. At that moment, however, few even knew how to exorcise such a simple being.\"\n\"Later, when a young Shrine Maiden caught wind of what happened, she took the umbrella out from the shrine, and washed it from the tip down using a wooden spoon. As she used a silk cloth to wipe its surface, she said this:\"\n\"'Even should the rains of yesterday cease, tomorrow and the day after remain. If that noble were still alive, your present state would surely be held unacceptable!'\"\n\"Hence, she had the umbrella enshrined in an annex of the temple. Since then, none have heard either hint or whisper regarding this umbrella again.\"\n\"Now, I heard this story from a friend of mine in Inazuma, although I did go around investigating the shrines around Narukami and found no mention of the umbrella being enshrined. When I told this to my friend, she just laughed:\"\n\"'Truly, Mademoiselle Leucade, do you take these kaidan to be the truth?'\"",

    "lore": "\"... Uh, what? A cheap cardboard claymore? No, no, no, this is... Well, it's... the Ultimate Overlord's Mega Magic Sword, once used to triumph over the Crab Emperor!\"\n\nA long, long time ago, before Romaritime Flowers came to have that name, in distant seas dwelt the great Crab Demon Emperor.\nNow, no one truly knows what made this crab great, nor do any know where this emperor ruled or where its subjects were, but since all attested to it, so did the mighty name of the Demon Emperor spread throughout the seas. Perhaps one might put this down to natural nobility? It was with this thought that the Crab Demon Emperor would slowly come to accept the truth that all gave it a wide berth.\nJust as the high-and-mighty (or perhaps that was simply how they thought of themselves) humans, this great eminence would often lament that its position precluded having friends (although this might itself might also indicate high-and-mightiness). After all, those clicking crab claws could easily scare those who antagonized you, and cut the threads of fate for those who insisted on doing so. And the hoard of gold coin that the emperor owned, that stood as high as Mont Automnequi, could buy it all the delicious cookies in Fontaine â€” and that was a life fit for a ruler, was it not?\nBut without good friends to play with it, at once driven to boredom and sadness â€” which no amount of cookies could cure â€” the great eminence had to resort to using those great claws to trim seagrass. And alas, the crab emperor was still a crab, and though he might do all things better than crabs, his skill at trimming seagrass was no better than that of an ordinary stingray!\nOne day, while the mighty Crab Demon Emperor was blowing bubbles, alone and forlorn, he bumped into a little Melusine...\n\"Ah, ah, ah! Who dares step into my demonic domain? Why have you come?\"\n(Though the Crab Emperor was erupting in flame, he was in truth a little happy, and also afraid. When other sea beings saw him, they would flee on account of his majesty, and so the Emperor had not spoken to anyone for a long, long time.)\n\"Mr. Crab,\" the little Melusine said, \"you don't seem very happy. Let's play together. That'll cheer you up!\"\n\"You do not understand,\" the Crab Emperor began, and though he wished to take the Melusine to task on account of her trespass in calling him \"Mr.\" instead of \"Your Majesty,\" he instead finished, \"an overlord cannot play with little Melusines, or he shall lose his kingly majesty.\"\n\"And what would happen if he loses it?\"\n\"An overlord without majesty is no overlord at all. Were it not for my claws being larger and my armor thicker than that of other crabs, I am ordinary, just like them.\"\n\"Well, Mr. Crab, your claws are bigger than me, and you have more legs than I do. Your armor is thicker than the walls of my house, and other than gold coins and little cookies, you've got so many other nice things. You should be very happy! Hmm, I know. It must be your kingly majesty that makes you unhappy.\"\n\"Little Melusine, you have never been a king, and so I forgive your ignorance. Know that an emperor should not care for his own happiness.\"\n\"But before you were king, you must've been a crab, right, Mr. Crab? Oh, your unhappiness makes me unhappy too! Tell you what â€” I'll help you give up your kingly majesty!\"\n\"Hah! Little Melusine, you speak of things far beyond your ken. When in history has an emperor given up their rule?\" The Emperor waved his claws in a rage. \"Unless... For example, and just as an example, a hero should defeat the demon lord using their holy blade... That way, even a former overlord must be content playing with the little Melusines.\"\n\"Oh, so that's how it works!\" The Melusine exclaimed happily, before then falling into thought, and saying, crestfallen, \"But I don't know where to find a hero, or where a holy blade might be...\"\n\"Oh, don't you worry! So long as they can defeat the demon lord, anyone can be a hero, and any weapon can be a holy sword,\" the Emperor said hurriedly. \"Mwahahaha! Now do you understand, you impertinent Melusine?\"\n\n\"'...And that's what Mr. Crab told me. Please, everyone, lend me your strength!'\" She said. And all the Melusines in Merusea Village thought that indeed, they should help her! And so they arrayed her with a great seashell for a shield, crowned her with a seagrass laurel, and canvas from a wrecked ship within Elynas they brought for her cloak. At last, they armed her with a rare piece of dried cardboard â€” her treasured sword.\nThus did the Melusine heroine embark on a journey to defeat the Crab Demon Emperor, and with her peerless magical blade did she cast the marauding tyrant down. And from then on, Mr. Crab, now longer a demon lord, would become the Melusines' good friend...\n\nAfter some discussion, the Melusines reached a consensus. This, the mightiest sword in Merusea Village, that had shone so illustriously in the shadowed mists of the past, should be given to an unparalleled hero, as a memorial to their friendship.",

    "lore": "Legends tell of how the Kitsune Urakusai once earned the undying enmity of the bake-danuki by cutting the gold-lacquered screen curtains of the stage within the forest while caught up in a drunken reverie.\nThis act earned his sword its name, and the Kitsune's drunken dance, blade wild beneath the moon, became a tale told amongst all who saw, save for the bake-danuki.\nLater, it is said that Urakusai apologized to the bake-danuki who had held the play, and gave them his precious teaset and other treasures.\nAnd he \"of the Front Gate,\" who had met him but once before the incident, received the blade \"Misugiri\" as a reward for mediating between the parties.\n\nAs for this recipient, he was slightly different from the rumors. Not only was he a strange character who had fought a vicious battle against Lavender Melon trees, but one who had a sense of elegance, enjoying plays, toys, and clothing.\nWhen throwing himself into battle, he would garb himself in golden brocade threaded with autumn grass and clouds, and the garish oil paints on his face would give him a fantastical form.\nHowever, neither ancient texts nor folk stories describe how he carried the great golden blade \"Misugiri\" in his final battle.\nInstead, his weapon is always the same in many anecdotes and stories, a prodigiously-sized blade with a name just as long and difficult to pronounce as his own.\nThough there are scrolls depict him wielding a sword in each hand, one large and one small, his majestic form cutting through the onrushing tide of black monsters,\nAccording to the authoritative \"Anthology\" of the time, \"Misugiri\" had already been lost by he \"of the Front Gate\" in the summer of some year before the disaster.\nFor this reason, the blade that may never have cut an enemy, \"Misugiri,\" has always piqued the imaginations of those who discuss historical tales while deep into their cups.\n\nAmong the Oni, who tell their history and legends only through song and chant and never through writing, there is a story that is different from or perhaps complementary to that which is recorded in the \"Anthology.\"\nAfter a wrestling match during a festival, he \"of the Front Gate\" gifted the renowned blade \"Misugiri\" to a tailor, who was not from a martial family.\nIt seems as though a young girl patched and mended a golden flower that had come loose from his haori, and he gifted her the sword at his side by way of reward.\n\n\"Whaddaya mean, you don't want a reward? How about this then: I'll trade this here sword of mine for your scissors! It won't count as a reward then, eh?\"\n\"Huh? What're you saying? Of course it can be used cut cloth! Such a young lady, but when you open your mouth, you actually sound like one of them boring tengu!\"\n\"What kind of lame excuse is 'there's a difference between martial families and commoners'!? You use such tiny little scissors to snip cloth! A nice long blade like this oughta work better, don'cha think?\"\n\"No way! I'm giving you this sword because its long-winded old owner just kept rambling on, something about how famous stuff oughta get hung on walls for people to admire.\"\n\"...I'm not just giving it to you, it's a transaction, y'know! Better that you cut some clothes with it than me having that old fox popping by to ask me how the sword's doing every few days!\"\n\"Hey, I can hear what you're saying about me! And keep my voice outta this! Whatever, just watch closelyâ€”!\"\n\nWith that, the Oni abruptly stood and drew the sword forth from the scabbard, its cold edge reflecting moonlight and the festival's smoke.\nThen, he cut one of his sleeves clean off with no hesitation, before sheathing the sword and sitting upright, offering the brocaded sleeve along with the sword.\nThis Oni warrior, who usually laughed and shouted in front of all and sundry upon the streets and cared little for minor matters, seemed a little more like a fierce fiend when serious.\n\n\"See? Even an oaf like me who doesn't know squat about tailoring can slice through cloth like butter using this here knife, so you'd best give it some credit, y'hear?\"\n\"Alright! Take good care of it, now! I'm figurin' that you're the only one who'll put it to good use! I'll just end up breaking it.\"\n\"You want me to keep it as some kinda family heirloom? Haha, I've thought about that! But a famous sword gets sad if it ain't used.\"\n\"And if that happens, next time Urakusai shows up, he'll mock me for being a dumb lout, boring, uncultured, y'know, that kinda claptrap.\"\n\nFace to face with the suddenly solemn Oni's visage, the young tailor girl of common birth was absolutely terrified.\nAfter waiting for the girl, now shaking with fear, to accept the precious thank-you gift, the Oni let loose a few great guffaws, thinking himself quite clever, and left most satisfied.\nHe \"of the Front Gate\" thus earned the title of \"The Great Idiot\" among the villagers, and he did not dislike it.\nThough he was quick to laugh and quick to anger, he made many friends and protected many lives in his life, which was itself neither exceptionally long nor overly short.\nAfterward, when countless textless embroidered scrolls were woven for those gods, kitsune, youkai, oni, and humans who protected lives beyond counting,\nWracked by guilt for never managing to return the blade to him to help him fell his foes, the tailor designed that awe-inspiring image of his likeness wielding two blades.\nBut that was later. Before that would come to pass, Urakusai had to first grieve for the scattered, wandering people for years.\n\nWhenever descendants of that Oni who bore his name saw one carrying the magnificent blade who was not the young seamstress, they would recall:\n\"Uncle often sighed as he cleaned that sword, blaming Urakusai for leaving such an extraordinary treasure to such an oaf like himself.\"\n\"'This thing outta enjoy the comfort and beauty of the world. How could I ever stand to taint it with slaughter and fury?'\"\n\nBut to get back on topic, when the girl discovered the blade's marvelous uses off the battlefield, it was still some time before she would weave that particular scroll.\nIn those days, the Oni Chiyo danced in her resplendent juunihitoe, sword in hand, dazzling as dainty flowers fluttering in the spring breeze.",

Remember that you are the eldest daughter of House Randolph.\"\n\"Understand that when we nobles sit down, we tilt the ship of state.\"\n\"And when we fall, we take countless homes and common folk with us in our crashing ruin.\"\n\"So listen well, dear Leticia.\"\n\"You must maintain your noble bearing and purity of appearance. Do not be quick to show anger, sadness, or joy.\"\n\"For our family name can grant a commoner prosperity, or send them to the Fleuve Cendre.\"\n\nBut though her father spoke thus, a young lady was still a young lady before she was a noble.\nWhen one's hands are unfettered by soot or machine oil, one's heart will hanker after \"adventure.\"\nBehind her father, brother, and servants' backs, she would don a disguise and step into the subterranean city that knew neither sun nor rain.\nShe just wanted to see the lives of those base folk who had no control over their destinies.\nPerhaps this might even be more interesting than Parsifal's magic! Such was the young lady's secret excitement.\nBut adventure was quite different from what she anticipated. For it was a thing unarranged by others,\nAnd so became a tale she could not tell to her peers or her aristocratic friends during their reunions.\nAnd when perils unseen â€” like music, lies, or poisoned wine â€” were about to be unsheathed and show their keen edge...\n\n\"Oh my. Whose daughter might you be, gentle lady, and what brings you to our Fleuve Cendre?\"\nIt was a gentle, familiar light that cast the appalling, encroaching shadows aside.\n\"You're...\"\nHis name was right on the tip of her tongue, but what slipped out instead was a question as to how her disguise had been discovered.\n\"Well, you're a terrible liar, for one. You've as much as admitted to being an outsider now, haven't you?\"\n\"...And my dear lady, your clothes lack either soot or machine oil, nor have they ever been stained by blood...\"\n\"And also, from the way you walk, you don't wear pants very often.\"\n\nWhen asked why Reed, whom she knew, could walk freely in the Fleuve Cendre, the young man said:\n\"I do hope that you agree that your good father, brother, and house-servants need not know what goes on here.\"\n\"Like the Boss says, 'Let all that the sun shines upon belong to them, and let the Fleuve Cendre belong to us.'\"\n\"Dear Leticia, please forget, at least for a time, that you are the eldest daughter of House Randolph,\"\n\"And come with me, as but a mere person, and with your bright eyes, that have never been covered in dust,\"\n\"See the world where your compatriots live, who, just like you, have red blood flowing in their veins, passions, and loves.\"\nStill, this was quite a different adventure from what she had expected, and, as fate would have it,\nShe would experience much that she could not tell her aristocratic friends and peers, or her servants, when they would meet and chat and laugh...\n\n\"Leticia, your noble soul is one I adore.\"\n\"No longer will our axes be swung at the trees.\"\n\"And if one day, I should be lost to the glories of this world,\"\n\"By your hand shall my fate be reckoned...\"\n\n...\nWhen she met her father once more, years later, she had already taken on the name of the rose,\nAnd she was no longer used to the fancy dresses once foisted on her, but was far more accustomed to the weight of an axe in her hand.\nYet she could not get used to the now fragile, hoary appearance of the dignified, gentle father she remembered.\n\n\"Dearest father, I have made a pact with my beloved, an oath to those I love.\"\n\"That I am still alive means that our blood is not yet spent.\"\n\"And I have yet to allow the Randolph name to be indelibly stained on my account.\"\n\n\"My dearest Leticia. Not a day goes by when I do not light a candle for you.\"\n\"Even now, though you wish to forsake our family name, we are still father and daughter.\"\n\"These trivial games have ended. Please, return home.\"\n\"Your child is innocent, and I will not abandon your flesh and blood for some fatuity.\"\n\"And as for your husband, well, there is some Randolph magic that can be worked there...\"\n\n...\nBut in dreams, she finally remembered. \"At that time, the pounding barrage of the naval cannons had not shaken us.\"\n\"No outsiders should have known the secret paths by which the hunters infiltrated.\"",

It is unique in that the edge closest to the wielder has been left dull.\nThe dull edge is said to have been used as the hilt, enabling the wielder to switch forms by constantly shifting hand positions in combat.\n\nThough it is rarely acknowledged, this greatsword was in fact a foreign bladesmith's labor of love.\nThe bladesmith knew himself to be dull of wits, and was anxious that this blade should not follow suit. Hence, he worked painstakingly on sharpening and balancing his beloved blade.\nSparks flew as the bladesmith worked through many sleepless nights.\nThe sword was recast and re-tempered countless times.\nAll the while his mind was consumed with the hope of his lover's return, as well as his untold anxiety for her well-being.\n\n\"After the war is over...\"\nThe bladesmith would ponder briefly, each time he paused for breath.\n\"Will this blade still be of use to her?\"\n\"Will she even make it home safely?\"\nThese thoughts would linger in his mind for but a moment before he cast them aside and refocused his full attention on the blade.\nIndulging irresolvable anxieties was a futile endeavor â€” better to focus his faculties on creating the perfect welcome-home gift.\n\nFinally, the day came when the triumphant expeditionary force entered the city gates, their monstrous foes defeated at last.\nBut the bladesmith had not had time to carve his lover's name onto the blade's body.\nWith no time to lose, he grabbed the sword and rushed to meet his lover on the occasion of her return.\nUnfortunately, what would transpire next was to be an unbearable anticlimax.\n\nAs the warrior removed her helmet, long, soft hair flowed down. She was growing her hair out, and hence would never need to wield a blade again for the rest of her days.\nMeanwhile, she had brought her lover a gift, too: A shiny new hunting bow.\n\"Romance is dead! I wasted all these years making you this greatsword, and now you don't even need it!\"\nThe bladesmith was thoroughly miserable and would not stop complaining about the unfairness of it all. But his efforts had by no means been in vain â€” at least he had finally succeeded in making a blade of the very finest quality.",

In the latter days of righteous governance, there are none left who sing of the gentleman thief, nor are such thieves needed anymore.\nWine and swords, maidens and heroes, a carefree opening and a happy ending, this vulgar sort of tale tends to be popular with the people.\nFor no matter how the real story went, or how the two truly ended up, wine and songs brim with hope.\nThey give the unfortunate a little courage to face tomorrow, and stand up to the powers that oppress them...",

After the merchant (or farmer) came to, the Knight was gone as well.\nThere are many versions of the story, though the daughter is always saved, and the Knight is always nameless.\n\nBut before the story was a story, he was merely a strange traveler clad in a dust-stained and tattered cloak. Some noticed the exquisitely crafted yet battle-worn armor beneath the cape. But that didn't mean anything. Perhaps the armor's bearer was just another lost soul who had lost their prestigious position with the changes wrought by revolution.\nThe tavern's owner noticed that the man paid with real gold and silver coins, though none recognized the symbols on them. Still, that too meant nothing, for gold and silver have no master and are always changing hands. Nor would anyone speak ill of a customer who paid their tab on the spot and was not prone to rowdy drunkenness.\nFor its part, the story came from a snake demon who arrived on Mondstadt's shores from the sea beyond the horizon, following the current of warmth and peace. In the early days of the Knights of Favonius, when they were still weak, the nameless knight left the city to hunt demons, for the price of a single silver coin. The scent of blood and carrion rotting on the beach attracted thousands of falcons, who circled for days. Thus, the true origin of the name of Falcon Coast comes not from the romantic legend of the Falcon of the West.\nIn the years afterwards, the Knights of Favonius did their utmost to convince the nameless knight to join them, but he never agreed. In reality, the events that corresponded to the story of \"Boreas\" likely happened between the Grand Master of the early days of the founding of the Knights and the nameless knight. The events unfolded such that the Grand Master, having lost patience after being rejected countless times, had the nameless knight surrounded in the street. The two famous lines in the story were likely spoken when the nameless knight \"Boreas\" left, and though the meaning was similar, the tone of both sides was far less civil.\nBut such a story would be exceedingly dull if committed to poetry, and thus talented bards took that dialogue, combined it with a few events surrounding the Knight while he was in Mondstadt, and from that wove a multitude of stories.\nThough he stayed in Mondstadt for but a few years, in leaving, his shadow has ever remained.",

The pale moon cast its cold light upon the winner and the defeated alike.\n\n\"Whichever direction the wind blows, there is never a single ripple in the cup of life.\"\n\"The three departed goddesses had long determined the heroes' fate, even if they could never fathom it themselves.\"\n\nThe wanderer took the moonlit sword, picked up the bloodstained silver coins, and trod in silence toward the distant rainforest.\nThus deprived of Xiphos' protection, the city lost its luster and withered away in the following years.\nIts buildings and gardens were ground down into the dirt along with its destiny, and then the howling desert gales consigned them to oblivion.\nUltimately, the black key and the young prince's quest to rejuvenate his kingdom both sank into the sand's embrace...",
