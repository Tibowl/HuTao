The result was that the teeth sprouted and began to grow upwards, using the priest's body as a support, finally transforming into the plant that we now call Grainfruit.\nAccording to a tradition of ancient origin, the shaft of the Grainfruit plant must never be casually disposed of, for it is believed to be the physical transformation and embodiment of Maghan's self-sacrifice.",
