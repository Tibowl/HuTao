This is because 100% of the Bond healing is consumed to clear her remaining Bond of Life.\n\nAn example would be 50% HP Bond of Life (15000 HP, 7500 Bond value) and 2000 attack, this will cause Arlecchino to heal for a total amount of `7500*50%+2000*150%=6750` health.",

The interruption resistance can be helpful when playing her without a shield, but does not alleviate her fragility.\n- **C2** - Removes the need to wait for setup, as **Blood-Debt Directives** will be **Due** when applied. Increases Arlecchino’s frontload potential by granting her an AoE nuke when she absorbs these **Dues**,  and further increases all her damage resistance by another 20% when this is triggered.\n- **C3** - As Arlecchino’s primary damage comes from her Normal Attacks, this Constellation offers a significant damage increase.\n- **C4** - Makes it easier to use Arlecchino’s Elemental Burst every rotation, the Cooldown Reduction is not particularly impactful however.\n- **C5** - Elemental Burst levels only increase the damage it does, not very significant overall, but works well with her final Constellation.\n- **C6** - Increases Arlecchino’s Elemental Burst damage by a massive amount based on her current amount of Bond of Life, making it worth using purely for damage.\n- Note that as this is scaling based on her current Bond of Life care should be taken not to use it at the end of a rotation when her Bond of Life has been depleted, instead it can often be ideal to use it immediately after her Elemental Skill to absorb the newly applied **Dues** which also resets her Elemental Skill to allow her to use it again if anything is still alive.\nAlso grants a significant CRIT Rate and CRIT Damage increase after using her Elemental Skill.
